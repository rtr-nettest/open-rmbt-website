<h1>1. Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The RTR-NetTest app can be used only after explicit consent to RTR’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for the
    RTR-NetTest. Note that the IP address is transferred, among others also to third countries (thus outside of the EU
    and the EEA) for which neither an adequacy decision nor appropriate safeguards exist. For further details see item
    1.2.1.3.</p>
<h2>1.1. General </h2>
<p>RTR offers users the opportunity to use the RTR-NetTest. Under 14 years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of
    their legal guardian. RTR’s legal authorisation to offer the RTR-NetTest is enshrined in <a
            href="https://www.rtr.at/TKG2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Art&nbsp;46 Par&nbsp;5 and Par&nbsp;6 and Art&nbsp;48 Telecommunications Act&nbsp;2021</a> as well as <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32015R2120"
                                                            title="Link to TSM Regulation" target="_blank"
                                                            class="external-link">Art 5 Par. 1 Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 ("TSM regulation")</a>.
    To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest
    possible transparency and information – while respecting their privacy – the RTR-NetTest is based on the open source
    and open data principle.</p>
<p>The RTR-NetTest comprises a test developed by RTR (= RTR Multithreaded Broadband Test, hereafter the
    <strong>RMB-Test</strong>).</p>
<h2>1.2. Processing of data by the RMB-Test </h2>
<h3>1.2.1. RMB-Test</h3>
<h4><strong>1.2.1.1. What data are processed?</strong></h4>
<p>The following data are processed as part of the <strong>RMB-Test</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speed of data connection in both directions (downlink/uplink)*</li>
    <li>Latency of data connection (ping)*</li>
    <li>Quality parameters (e.g. signal strength, connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, transfer
        time for a reference web page, background traffic volume, Domain Name System server queries, Traceroute, VoIP
        test call)*
    </li>

    <li>Evidence of acceptance of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</li>
    <li>Public client ID*</li>
    <li>Client sync code and group</li>
    <li>Test time*</li>
    <li>Client location (if known) / time zone*</li>
    <li>Meta information for the client location (e.g. location accuracy, method of location fix, covered distance)*
    </li>
    <li>Device type/model, operating system/software version of app*</li>
    <li>NAT Yes/No (direct Internet access or private address used)*</li>
    <li>Roaming status (national, international roaming)*</li>
    <li>IP version*</li>
    <li>IP address</li>

        network, used frequency, frequency band, base station identification)*
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The data marked with * are published on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely
    available to the general public as open data (<a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata"
                                                     title="Link to Open Data" target="_blank"
                                                     rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>)
    for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
<h4><strong>1.2.1.2. Processing of personal data and the purposes for processing of personal data </strong></h4>
<p>Only with the solely agreement of the user the following personal data are processed in the course of the RMB-Test:
    (1) the <strong>Client UUID</strong>, (2) the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>
    as well as (3) the <strong>IP address</strong>.</p>
<p>Purposes for processing these personal data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>Client UUID</strong>: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user;
        identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; Percipience of the rights of the uses
        according to item 1.4.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>:
        presentation in the user’s history; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>IP address</strong>: Technical enabling of the RTR-NetTest and ensuring the full
        functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; in order to be able to assign the
        tests to individual operators (via routing information [AS] or host names); detection of improper use or
        malfunctions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>1.2.1.3. Transferring of personal data</strong></h4>
<p>The IP address is transferred, among others also to <strong>third countries</strong>:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>within the EU and the EEA</strong>: Depending on the used website and terminal, for the representation
        of the maps and for position determination, map data from basemap.at (<a href="https://basemap.at"
                                                                                 target="_blank"
                                                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">https://basemap.at</a>)
        and OpenStreetMap (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.openstreetmap.org</a>)
        are retrieved.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third countries</strong>: In order to conduct DNS tests as part of the quality tests, DNS requests are
        sent to public DNS servers of Google (<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com</a>), Cloudflare (<a
                href="https://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cloudflare.com</a>) and Quad9 (<a href="https://www.quad9.net"
                                                                                        target="_blank"
                                                                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.quad9.net</a>).
        Depending on the used website and terminal, for the representation of the maps and for position determination,
        map data from Google (<a href="https://www.google.at" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.at</a>)
        und Microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com</a>)
        are retrieved.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The transfer of data to Google, Cloudflare and Microsoft is based on adequacy decisions of the Commission - according
    to Art 45 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Regarding Quad9 neither an adequacy decisions nor appropriate
    safeguards according to Art 46 GDPR exist. A possible risk of such a transfer is that the IP address of the user is
    transferred to Quad9 and thus conclusions on the executing of the RTR-NetTest may be drawn.</p>
<h2>1.3. Duration of storage of personal data </h2>
<p>The <strong>IP address</strong>, the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID
        (BSSID)</strong> are stored by RTR for a maximum period of six months. In any case the <strong>Client
        UUID</strong> will be deleted with the final termination of the RTR-NetTest.</p>
<h2>1.4. Rights of users in connection with personal data </h2>
<p>By providing the randomly generated client ID (= <strong>Client UUID</strong>)- which can be found in the app under
    Info - the user has amongst others the following rights concerning her or his personal data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>information;</li>
    <li>erasure, thus to withdraw her or his acceptance to the processing of her or his personal data at any time;</li>
    <li>lodging a complaint with the supervision authority (<a href="https://www.dsb.gv.at" target="_blank"
                                                               rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.dsb.gv.at</a>);
    </li>
    <li>rectification;</li>
    <li>restriction;</li>
    <li>data portability.</li>
