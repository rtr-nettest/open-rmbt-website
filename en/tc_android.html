<h1>1. Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>1.1. General </h2>
<p>The use of the RTR-NetTest app is only possible after explicit consent to RTR’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use for
    the RTR-NetTest. Under 14 years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of their legal guardian(s). Note that the
    IP address is transferred, among others, also to third countries (thus outside of the European Union, EU, and the
    European Economic Area, EEA) for which neither an adequacy decision nor appropriate safeguards exist. For further
    details see point 1.4.
</p>
<p>The RTR-NetTest informs users about the current service quality (including upload, download, ping, signal strength)
    of their Internet connection. For technically interested users RTR-NetTest provides two further options: On the one
    hand, RTR-NetTest offers a loop-mode, which enables automatically repeated RTR-NetTests; on the other hand, with
    the signal-only loop-mode signal measurements are also carried out repeatedly - without speed- or quality tests
    being carried out.
</p>
<p>RTR’s legal authorisation to offer RTR-NetTest is enshrined in&nbsp;<a
        href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20011678" title="Link to TKG 2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        class="external-link">Art&nbsp;46 Par&nbsp;5 and Par&nbsp;6 and Art&nbsp;48 Telecommunications Act 2021</a> as well as <a

        title="Link to TSM Regulation" target="_blank"
        class="external-link">Art 4 Par 4 and Art 5 Par 1 Regulation (EU) 2015/2120</a>.
    To fulfil this duty and ensure users with the greatest possible transparency and information – while respecting
    their privacy – RTR-NetTest is based on the open source and open data principle.
<h2>1.2. Which data are processed?</h2>
<h3>1.2.1. RTR-NetTest</h3>
<p>The following data are processed as part of the <strong>RTR-NetTest</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Speed of data connection in both directions (downlink/uplink)*</li>
    <li>Latency of data connection (ping)*</li>
    <li>Quality parameters (eg signal strength, connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, transfer
        time for a reference web page, background traffic volume, Domain Name System server queries, Traceroute, VoIP
        test call)*
    </li>
    <li>Test parameters (test method, test progress, test server, test configuration [eg test duration])*</li>
    <li>Environmental conditions of the measurement (temperature, utilization of the measurement device including
        CPU load)*</li>
    <li>Randomly generated client ID (Client UUID)</li>
    <li>Evidence of acceptance of the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</li>
    <li>Public client ID*</li>
    <li>Client sync code and client sync group as well as language settings of the client</li>
    <li>Test time*</li>
    <li>Client location (if known) / time zone*</li>
    <li>Meta information for the client location (eg location accuracy, method of location fix, covered distance)*
    </li>
    <li>Device type/model, operating system/software version of app*</li>
    <li>NAT Yes/No (direct Internet access or private address used)*</li>
    <li>Roaming status (national, international roaming)*</li>
    <li>IP version*</li>
    <li>IP address (including host name)</li>
    <li>IP network (autonomous system, AS) and anonymised IP address*</li>
    <li>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</li>
    <li>Mobile network (eg home network, network used, type of connection [GSM, UMTS, LTE, NR etc], name of the mobile
        network, used frequency, frequency band, base station identification)*
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The data marked with * are published on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely
    available to the general public as open data (<a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata"
                                                     title="Link to Open Data" target="_blank"
                                                     rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata</a>)
    for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
<p>Note: After consent to the privacy policy is given the authorisation "Allow RTR-NetTest to start and manage calls"
    appears for devices that have multiple SIM cards. This is specified by the operating system of the device. In
    the context of RTR-NetTest the identification of the SIM card, which is used for data traffic, is thus enabled. No
    other possible functions based on this authorisation are used by RTR-NetTest. </p>
<h3>1.2.2. Loop-mode option</h3>
<p>
    The loop-mode option for technically interested users allows the automatic repetition of RTR-NetTest. The first
    test starts right after activation of the loop-modus; further tests are carried out when either the waiting time
    has elapsed or the specified distance has been covered. Tests will be
    performed until the configured number of tests has been reached. The signal strength is measured
    continuously, also between two tests. The loop-modus can be stopped at any time respectively it stops after 48
    hours. It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the loop modus it cannot be excluded that the tester is
    identified.
</p>
<p>The same data as listed under 1.2.1 are processed.
    The data marked with * are published on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely
    available to the general public as open data (<a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata"
                                                     title="Link to Open Data" target="_blank"

    for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>
<h3>1.2.3. Signal-only loop-mode option</h3>
<p>
    The signal-only loop-mode option for technically interested users allows the automatic repetition of signal
    measurements - without any speed- or quality tests being carried out. The signal-only loop-modus can be stopped at
    any time respectively it stops automatically after 48 hours. It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the
    signal-only loop modus it cannot be excluded that the tester is identified.
</p>
<p>The same data as listed under 1.2.1 are processed – with the exception that the latency of the data connection
    (ping), the connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, the transfer time for a reference web page,
    the background traffic volume, Domain Name System server queries, the traceroute, the VoIP test call are not tested
    and thus no data exist that could be processed.</p>
<p>
    The data marked with * are published on the RTR-NetTest website and in the RTR-NetTest app and are made freely
    available to the general public as open data (<a href="https://www.netztest.at/en/Opendata"
                                                     title="Link to Open Data" target="_blank"

    for information, use, dissemination and other applications.</p>

<h2>1.3. Processing and the purposes for processing of personal data </h2>
<p><strong>Processing</strong></p>
<p>the following personal data are processed in the course of the RTR-NetTest, the option loop-modus and the option signal-only loop-mode:
    (1) the <strong>Client UUID</strong>, (2) the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID) and numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>
    as well as (3) the <strong>IP address</strong>.</p>
<h3>Purposes for processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>Client UUID</strong>: possibility of compiling a test result history for the user;
        identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions; Percipience of the rights of the uses
        according to item 1.6.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID (BSSID)</strong>:
        presentation in the user’s history; identifying associated tests to identify improper use or malfunctions.
    </li>
    <li>in respect to the <strong>IP address</strong>: Technical enabling of the RTR-NetTest and ensuring the full
        functionality, in particular display of the map and quality measurements; in order to be able to assign the
        tests to individual operators (via routing information [AS] or host names); detection of improper use or
        malfunctions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>1.4. Transferring</h2>
<p>The IP address is transferred, among others, also to <strong>third countries</strong>:<strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>within the EU and the EEA</strong>: Depending on the website and terminal equipment used, map data from
        basemap.at (<a href="https://basemap.at"
                       target="_blank"
                       rel="noopener noreferrer">https://basemap.at</a>)
        and OpenStreetMap (<a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.openstreetmap.org</a>)
        are retrieved in order to enable the map display as well as the position determination.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Third countries</strong>: In order to conduct DNS tests as part of the quality tests, DNS requests are
        sent to public DNS servers of Google (<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank"
                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com</a>), Cloudflare (<a
                href="https://www.cloudflare.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cloudflare.com</a>) and Quad9 (<a href="https://www.quad9.net"
                                                                                        target="_blank"
                                                                                        rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.quad9.net</a>).
        Depending on the website and terminal equipment used, data from Google (<a href="https://www.google.at"
                                                                                   target="_blank"
                                                                                   rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.at</a>)
        and Microsoft (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.microsoft.com</a>)
        are retrieved in order to enable the map display as well as the position determination.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>The transfer of data to Google, Cloudflare and Microsoft is based on adequacy decisions of the Commission - according
    to Art 45 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Regarding Quad9 neither an adequacy decisions nor appropriate
    safeguards according to Art 46 GDPR exist. A possible risk of such a transfer is that the IP address of the user is
    transferred to Quad9 and thus conclusions on the executing of RTR-NetTest may be drawn.</p>
<h2>1.5. Duration of storage of personal data </h2>
<p>The <strong>IP address</strong>, the <strong>WLAN network ID (SSID)</strong> and <strong>numerical WLAN ID
    (BSSID)</strong> are stored by RTR for a maximum period of six months. In any case the <strong>Client
    UUID</strong> will be deleted with the final termination of the RTR-NetTest.</p>
<h2>1.6. Rights of users in connection with personal data </h2>

<h1>2. Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Users use the browser version and app of the RTR-NetTest at their own risk. Please send any comments on correction of
    inaccurate content, graphics etc. by e-mail to <a href="mailto:netztest@rtr.at">netztest@rtr.at</a>. Under 14
    years can use the RTR-NetTest with the consent of their legal guardian(s).</p>
<p>The RTR-NetTest informs users about the current service quality (including upload, download, ping, signal strength)
    of their Internet connection. The Android app features two options for technically interested users: On the one
    hand, RTR-NetTest offers a loop-modus, which enables automatically repeated RTR-NetTests (note: in pauses between
    the tests signal measurements continue); on the other hand, with the signal-only loop-modus signal measurements are
    also carried out repeatedly - without any speed- or quality tests. </p>
<p>In the event of a great demand or very high number of tests in a specific area, the loop-modus can be rejected by the
    test system in order to avoid overload. Please note that the loop-modus is (only)
    intended for use within the EU and the EEA. The loop-modus consumes a large amount of data. With fast connections,
    10 tests can consume 1 GB or more of data. It is therefore strongly recommended that the loop-modus is only used
    with real flat rate tariffs, where additional data volume does not cause additional costs. The loop-modus drains the
    battery quickly. In pauses between the tests, the GPS and the display remain active and signal measurements
    continue, which means that the energy is used up much faster than during stand-by mode. The loop-modus should
    therefore only be used if an external power supply is available. The same applies to the signal-only loop-modus: The
    signal-only loop-modus is (only) intended for use within the EU and the EEA. The battery is quickly drained by the
    signal-only measurements. In the pauses between tests, the GPS and the display remain active and signal measurements
    continue, which means that the energy is used up much faster than in stand-by mode. The loop-modus should therefore
    only be used if an external power supply is available.</p>
