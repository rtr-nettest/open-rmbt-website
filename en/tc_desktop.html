<p>The RTR-NetTest informs users about the current service quality (including upload, download, ping, signal strength) of their Internet connection. Additionally RTR-NetTest offers the option to repeat tests automatically (loop mode). Furthermore, in case a provider in Austria provides the Internet access, the browser test offers the possibility to undertake a certified measurement. With this, conclusive statements about the quality of the Internet access of a user can be made. They serve as the basis for a so-called "prima facie proof" of certain aspects of this Internet connection.</p>
