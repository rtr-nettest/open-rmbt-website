<p>The loop mode allows the automatic repetition of RTR-NetTest.</p>
<p>
  The first test will start immediately after the loop mode has been initiated.
  Further tests will be started after the waiting time (default 30 minutes) has
  elapsed. These values can be changed under “Settings”. Tests will be performed
  until the configured number of tests (default 10 tests) has been reached. The
  loop mode is automatically terminated after 2 days. The loop mode can be
  stopped at any time.
</p>
<p>
  It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the loop mode it cannot be
  excluded that the tester is identified.
