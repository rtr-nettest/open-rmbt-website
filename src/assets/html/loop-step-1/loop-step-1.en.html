<p>The loop mode allows the automatic repetition of RTR-NetTest.</p>
<p>
  The first test will start immediately after the loop mode has been initiated.
  Further tests will be started after the waiting time (between 5 and 1440 minutes, default 15 minutes) has
  elapsed. Tests will be performed until the configured number of tests (between 1 and 500 tests, default 50 tests) has
  been reached. These values can be changed under “Settings”. The
  loop mode is automatically terminated after 2 days. The loop mode can be
  stopped at any time.
</p>
<p>
  It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the loop mode it cannot be
  excluded that the tester is identified.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of high demand or a high number of tests in a specific area, loop
  mode tests may be rejected by the test system in order to avoid overload. It
  should be noted that the loop mode is intended (only) for usage within the EU
  and EFTA states.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that the loop modus consumes a huge amount of data. With
  high-speed connections 10 tests can consume 1GB or more. Therefore it is
  highly recommended to run the loop mode only with a true flat rate tariff
  where additional traffic des not generate additional costs.
</p>
<p>
  The loop mode also consumes a lot of battery power. Between the loop tests,
  the loop mode keeps GPS and the display active, thus the battery is drained
  much faster than in standbymode. In addition, tests also consume power.
  Therefore the loop mode should be used only if an extended power supply is
  available.
